            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hello! I'm Zaayan Javed, a dedicated Computer Information Science student at St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas. I'm a Computer Information Science student passionate about software development, business strategy, and AI. 
                I love using technology to solve problems and improve processes. 
                My studies have given me strong programming skills, and my interest in business helps me see how tech drives innovation.
                Recently, I’ve developed a deep passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning. With AI growing fast, I aim to blend it with my knowledge of software and business to create smarter solutions. 
                I am currently interning with Klein Fitness, a startup company aiming to compete with bigger fitness apps. Our sole difference is the first implementation of an AI personal trainer that will allow the user to create specialized workout plans curated specifically for them depending on their current condition and fitness goals.
                I hope to gain more insight on how the real job environment fluctuates, working real time with a whole group of other developers, and learn more about project management throuhgout the course of this project. </p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <h3>Personal Fitness</h3>

            <p>Fitness has always been a big part of my life. Whether I’m lifting weights, running, or playing sports, staying active makes me feel my best. It’s not just about staying in shape—it clears my mind, keeps me motivated, and helps me handle challenges in and out of the gym. I’ve seen firsthand how being active can change your mindset, boost confidence, and improve overall well-being. I truly believe that no matter where you start, finding a way to move and stay active can make a huge difference in how you feel every day. </p>

            <h3>Gaming</h3>

            </a>
            <p>Gaming has always been one of my favorite ways to unwind. After a busy day, it’s my way to escape, relax, and reset. Whether I’m teaming up with friends in a voice chat or diving into a single-player story, gaming gives me a break from everything else going on. Lately, I’ve been enjoying Marvel Rivals, but I’m a fan of all kinds of games—multiplayer and single-player. From fast-paced action in Call of Duty to the incredible storytelling of God of War and Ghost of Tsushima, I love exploring different worlds and experiences. For me, gaming isn’t just entertainment—it’s a way to connect, recharge, and have fun. </p>
